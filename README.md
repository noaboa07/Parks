# Lab 5 - *Parks*

Submitted by: **Noah Russell** **Z23667779**

**Parks** is an app that will allow users to explore national parks , conveniently filtered by state. By selecting a park, users can navigate to a detail screen offering more comprehensive information about the park, additional images, and a map showcasing the park's location. Although the SwiftUI implementation details may be new, your past experience in building REST clients with UIKit will give you an advantage, as the app's high-level structure and design remain similar. So lace up your hiking boots and get ready to hit the trail!
